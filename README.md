### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - I always rely on CSS Tricks guides when I want to use either CSS Grid or CSS Flexbox and forget about some syntax.
- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I've found this webpage guides very useful so I link them in case anyone wants to learn.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I didn't use MDN Web Docs in this particular project but I really recommend it for an in depth HTML, CSS or JS documentation.
- [Tailwindcss Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - If I ever forget about any Tailwindcss class name I just come here to remember it.
